              Founder and operator, Phil Clark, has had over 30 years of
              experience competing and training at the world-class level,
              coaching top athletes, and writing about fitness. He works with
              each staff-instructor to determine the best exercises to do (and
              the exercises to avoid), the best order of those exercises, how
              the client should be instructed to do those exercises, and what to
              do when the client struggles to follow the instructions.
